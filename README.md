# Automated-Railway-Level-Crossing-Gate-Security-System
The "Automated Railway Level Crossing Gate Security System" uses Arduino to automate gate control at railway crossings. It employs an ultrasonic sensor to detect approaching trains. When a train is detected within 10 cm, a servo motor lowers the gate, enhancing safety by preventing vehicle entry onto the tracks.
